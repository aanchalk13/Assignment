          “By discovering nature, you discover yourself.” –  Maxime Lagacé, A beautifully penned sentence. Nature is the entire physical world around us in a broad sense. It includes atmosphere, weather, ecosystem,flora, fauna, and landscapes. The beautiful environment
           around us who we call nature is the mother of all humans. It nurtures and nourishes
           us. It provides us with all the necessities to survive. Right from the food we eat,
           the air we breathe, the clothes we wear, and the houses we live in are the gift of
           nature. God has only gifted earth with nature, and we should be thankful for that.

          The presence of beautiful and attractive environment around us is called nature. Nature is our mother, it nourishes
           and nurtures us.    All basic necessities of life are provided from nature. The food to eat, the water to drink,
           air to breathe and land to live comes from nature.
           us is nature.
